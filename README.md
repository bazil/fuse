bazil.org/fuse -- Filesystems in Go
===================================

`bazil.org/fuse` is a Go library for writing FUSE userspace
filesystems.

It is a from-scratch implementation of the kernel-userspace
communication protocol, and does not use the C library from the
project called FUSE. `bazil.org/fuse` embraces Go fully for safety and
ease of programming.

Hereâ€™s how to get going:

    go get bazil.org/fuse

based on.

# Quick Start #

Recipe using Go Modules (requires Go 1.12 or higher).
